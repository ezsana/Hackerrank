Day of the programmer:
- it was difficult not to think as a developer but as a tester;
- even with very simple unit tests you need to think properly through every possible test case and edge cases;
- after all of my test cases passed, the code also passed the hackerrank test cases.

Big sorting:
- unclear acceptance criteria
- my tests only tested integer but not BigInt => I needed to change them
- working with BigInt is more complicated
- time limit is a problem (my tests didn't cover that), I need to refactor the code
- output was just the String[], not needed to print is out

Chocolate Feast:
- concentrating on one test to pass at a time;
- one test was wrong! Beware!!!
- all tests passing except performance - time limits! => refactoring needed;

Cavity Map:
- huge misunderstanding in requirements (paramaters of method cavityMap) =>
  * method theoretically does the right thing but in reality not
- changed all the tests => experience how bad it is if one misunderstands the requirements
