Day of the programmer:
- it was difficult not to think as a developer but as a tester;
- even with very simple unit tests you need to think properly through every possible test case and edge cases;
- after all of my test cases passed, the code also passed the hackerrank test cases.

Big sorting:
- unclear acceptance criteria
- my tests only tested integer but not BigInt => I needed to change them
- working with BigInt is more complicated
- time limit is a problem (my tests didn't cover that), I need to refactor the code
- output was just the String[], not needed to print is out

Chocolate Feast:
- concentrating on one test to pass at a time;
- one test was wrong! Beware!!!
- all tests passing except performance - time limits! => refactoring needed;

Cavity Map:
- huge misunderstanding in requirements (parameters of method cavityMap) =>
  * method theoretically does the right thing but in reality not
- changed all the tests => experience how bad it is if one misunderstands the requirements

Circular Array Rotation:
- only tests with time limit didn't pass

Designer pdf:
- not too much testcase, not on Hackerrank either

Electronic Shop:
- nothing special, all tests (Hackerrank as well) passed;

Cut The Sticks:
- sometimes test cases coming up when solving the challenge (moreThanOneLastElement);

Encryption:
- no answer in the requirements if len(s) = 3 after removing spaces => it's 1,7, but
    row is 1 and columns are two => impossible:
    aaa or aa a - neither satisfies the constraints;
    => last example: 8: same problem, got the solution
